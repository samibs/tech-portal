# TechPortal Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

TechPortal addresses the critical need for centralized application management in modern development environments where teams manage multiple applications, services, and processes across different platforms.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. **Fragmented Application Management**
- **Problem**: Developers manually manage multiple applications using different commands and interfaces
- **Solution**: Single unified interface for all application lifecycle operations

### 2. **Inconsistent Monitoring**
- **Problem**: No standardized way to monitor application health across different environments
- **Solution**: Multi-layered monitoring system with configurable intervals and real-time updates

### 3. **Platform Incompatibility**
- **Problem**: Different commands and procedures for Windows vs Linux/macOS environments
- **Solution**: Cross-platform management scripts with identical syntax

### 4. **Manual Process Management**
- **Problem**: Tedious manual start/stop/restart operations with potential for human error
- **Solution**: Automated process management with intelligent error handling

### 5. **Limited Visibility**
- **Problem**: Lack of centralized visibility into application status and performance
- **Solution**: Real-time dashboard with comprehensive metrics and logging

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. **Setup**: Simple installation with automated configuration
2. **Registration**: Easy application registration through intuitive interface
3. **Management**: One-click start/stop/restart operations
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time status updates and health checks
5. **Troubleshooting**: Comprehensive logging and error reporting

### Core Workflows

#### Application Management Workflow
```
Register App → Configure Monitoring → Start/Stop/Restart → Monitor Status → View Logs
```

#### Monitoring Workflow
```
Health Checks → Status Updates → Alert Generation → Log Analysis → Recommendations
```

#### Development Workflow
```
Setup Environment → Start Dev Mode → Code Changes → Auto-reload → Test → Deploy
```
