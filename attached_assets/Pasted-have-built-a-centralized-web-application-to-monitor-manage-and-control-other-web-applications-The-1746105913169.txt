have built a centralized web application to monitor, manage, and control other web applications. The core and optional features are defined below.

Checklist:

✅ Core Features:

 App registration UI with fields: App Name, Project URL, Start Command, Port Number, App Type

 Persistent storage of registered apps (e.g., JSON or embedded DB)

 Periodic status checks for each app (HTTP probe or port check based on type)

 Configurable check frequency

 Clear status display with indicators: Running, Stopped, Unreachable, Error

 Start/Stop controls in the UI with error handling

 Subprocess or API-based command execution (if applicable)

✅ UI/UX:

 Responsive layout (mobile/tablet/desktop)

 Clear card/table layout for apps

 Visual feedback (status color codes, icons, tooltips)

 Toast notifications for app state changes or errors

✅ Enhancements:

 Logging of actions (start/stop/status changes/errors)

 Display recent logs in UI

 Optional auto-restart of stopped/unreachable apps with retry config

 Health check endpoint support (/health)

 Notifications for failures or restarts

 Authentication and role-based access

 Public API for external automation

 Environment variable manager (optional)

 Resource usage display (if data is available)

 Deployment triggers or restart hooks (stretch goal)

Instructions:

Review all items above.

If any feature is missing or incomplete, finish implementing it.

If features are implemented, double-check for UI polish and consistency.

On your own initiative, go beyond the spec where reasonable to improve UX, such as:

Smooth animations on status changes

Drag-and-drop app reordering

Editable app details post-registration

Dark mode toggle

Minimal onboarding walkthrough for first-time users

Smart grouping (e.g., group apps by type or status)

Persistent UI state (e.g., last selected view, auto-scroll to active apps)

Visual activity timeline/log

System health summary panel at the top (e.g., total running apps, total errors)

Lazy loading or pagination if many apps are registered

Full accessibility support (keyboard nav, ARIA labels, etc.)

Then confirm:

✅ Are all core and enhancement features implemented and polished to production-grade UX/UI? If not, complete them now.
